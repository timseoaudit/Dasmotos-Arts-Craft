A Codecademy project where i for the first time needed to code a site on my own without a step to step guide. All i Had was a Stylesheet. It worked well and I did not face many problems.
Only when i needed to add the background picture I did struggle as my path was not relative to the css file, this took me about 45min to find the problem, but worth it.
